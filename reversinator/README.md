# SammyJs Reversinator

A VST3/AU audio plugin that provides real-time audio reversal effects, inspired by the classic Backwards Machine plugin. Create psychedelic reverse effects, experimental soundscapes, and unique time-based audio manipulations.

## Features

- **Three Reverse Modes**:
  - **Reverse Playback** - Continuous reverse effect with smooth transitions
  - **Forward Backwards** - Alternating forward and reverse playback with crossfading
  - **Reverse Repeat** - Double playback with vibrato effect on the reversed portion
  
- **Adjustable Window Time** (30ms - 2s) - Control the size of the reverse buffer
- **Feedback Control** - Add echo-like effects to the reversed signal
- **Wet/Dry Mix Controls** - Blend reversed and original signals independently
- **Crossfade Control** - Smooth transitions in Forward Backwards mode
- **Low Latency Processing** - Optimized for real-time performance
- **Click-Free Operation** - Advanced anti-click algorithms for smooth audio

## Building

### Prerequisites
- macOS (tested on macOS 12+) or Windows 10/11
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS) or Visual Studio 2022 (Windows)

### Build Instructions

#### macOS
```bash
cd reversinator
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release
```

#### Windows
```cmd
cd reversinator
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release
```

The plugin will be built to:
- VST3: `build/Reversinator_artefacts/Release/VST3/`
- AU (macOS only): `build/Reversinator_artefacts/Release/AU/`

## Installation

### macOS
- Copy the `.vst3` file to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`
- Copy the `.component` file to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/`

### Windows
- Copy the `.vst3` folder to `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`

## Usage

1. Load the plugin in your DAW as a VST3 or AU effect
2. Enable the **Reverser** button to activate the effect
3. Select your desired **Effect Mode**:
   - **Reverse Playback**: Classic tape-reverse effect
   - **Forward Backwards**: Ping-pong style forward/reverse
   - **Reverse Repeat**: Adds vibrato to the reversed signal
4. Adjust the **Window Time** to control the reverse buffer size
5. Set **Wet Mix** and **Dry Mix** levels to taste

## Controls

### Main Controls

- **Reverser** - Master on/off switch for the effect

- **Effect Mode** - Choose between three reverse algorithms:
  - **Reverse Playback**: Continuously reverses audio in chunks
  - **Forward Backwards**: Alternates between forward and reverse playback
  - **Reverse Repeat**: Plays forward then reverses with vibrato

### Time & Modulation

- **Window Time** (30ms - 2s): Size of the reverse window
  - Smaller values (30-200ms): Granular, glitchy effects
  - Medium values (200-500ms): Classic reverse sounds
  - Larger values (500ms-2s): Long, sweeping reverses

- **Crossfade** (0-100%): Smoothness of transitions (Forward Backwards mode only)
  - 0%: Sharp transitions
  - 50%: Balanced blend
  - 100%: Maximum smoothing

### Feedback & Mix

- **Feedback Depth** (0-100%): Amount of reversed signal fed back
  - Creates echo and delay-like effects
  - Higher values create more complex textures

- **Wet Mix** (0-100%): Level of the reversed signal
  - 0%: No reversed signal
  - 100%: Full reversed signal

- **Dry Mix** (0-100%): Level of the original signal
  - 0%: No original signal
  - 100%: Full original signal

## Tips & Tricks

### Creative Uses

1. **Reverse Reverb**: Place before a reverb for classic reverse reverb effects
2. **Rhythmic Effects**: Sync window time to tempo for rhythmic reversing
3. **Ambient Textures**: Long window times with high feedback for soundscapes
4. **Glitch Effects**: Short window times (30-100ms) for stuttering effects
5. **Transition Effects**: Automate the Reverser button for dramatic transitions

### Recommended Settings

**Subtle Reverse Effect**
- Mode: Reverse Playback
- Window: 500ms
- Feedback: 20%
- Wet: 50%, Dry: 50%

**Psychedelic Sweep**
- Mode: Forward Backwards
- Window: 1s
- Crossfade: 70%
- Feedback: 40%
- Wet: 80%, Dry: 20%

**Glitch Stutter**
- Mode: Reverse Repeat
- Window: 50ms
- Feedback: 60%
- Wet: 100%, Dry: 0%

## Troubleshooting

- **Clicking or popping**: Window time is automatically limited to 30ms minimum to prevent clicks
- **No sound**: Check that Reverser is enabled and Wet Mix is above 0%
- **CPU usage**: Larger window times use more memory but not necessarily more CPU

## Technical Details

### Anti-Click Technology

Reversinator uses several techniques to ensure click-free operation:
- Dynamic fade lengths that scale with window size
- Hann window fading for smooth transitions
- Circular buffer with 3x overallocation to prevent wrap errors
- Anti-denormal noise injection
- Minimum 30ms window time enforcement

### Buffer Management

The plugin uses efficient circular buffers for each channel with:
- Real-time safe memory allocation
- Lock-free audio processing
- Automatic buffer resizing when parameters change
- Separate buffers for each effect mode
